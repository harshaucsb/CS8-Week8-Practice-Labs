## Step 0

- Create a branch and don't update the main directly
- Feel free to name the branch with your name and the corresponding Zybooks section

## Step 1

- Come up with a question from the assigned section and create a function similar to the existing one
- Make sure it has different brances and possible return values
- Add this function in "tests/correct.py" and add your assert statements there
- Make sure to run correct.py file to see if your code is working correctly
- Refer to "get_dictionary_value" for any queries

## Step 2

- Create a test file under "tests" directory similar to "test_dictionary_values.py" file
- You can copy paste the code from it and update the params and all TODO sections

## Step 3

- Add the corresponding file names to "test/config.py" file in "fun_names_dict" and "test_files" variable

## Step 4

- Commit your changes
- Raise a PR to merge these changes to main and add "Harsha" as the approver and reviewer
